# RFID-Attendance_System
My project using ESP32 and RFID.
This real world problem sloving project is done by our team, which consist of Myself, Parau, Sonu, Sarita, Baibhav and Sujita.
Here, we make a system using ESP32 which let us know and collect data of student from RFID tag and then store in Google sheet. So, it can be accessible to everyone.


## Update is coming soon ...
